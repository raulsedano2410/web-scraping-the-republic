    "    <p>The <code>MySpider</code> class is designed to handle web scraping operations for news articles from the main page of <em>La Repubblica</em>, an Italian newspaper. It initiates HTTP requests to retrieve article data from specified URLs and parses the HTML content to extract relevant information such as titles, links, and publication dates.</p>\n",
    "    <p>The class manages the process of crawling through a list of start URLs, avoiding revisiting previously visited URLs, and storing visited URLs to prevent duplicate scraping. It implements a basic spider logic, making HTTP requests, handling response parsing, and writing scraped data to a CSV file.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Key methods include:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li><code>start_requests()</code>: Initiates the scraping process by making HTTP requests to start URLs, avoiding revisiting visited URLs, and handling 403 errors by waiting before retrying.</li>\n",
    "      <li><code>parse(response)</code>: Parses the HTML content of each response, extracts article data, and writes it to a CSV file.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <p>The class encapsulates the scraping logic, making it reusable and modular for different scraping tasks.</p>\n",
